# How to Contribute

Hey there! Glad that you're interested in contributing! We really
appreciate it. :tada:

## Background

Here are the quick and dirty details that you should know about how we
work.

* `master` branch is automatically deployed to our live website.
* All changes are made through pull requests.

## Contributing

Here are the general steps that we recommend you follow to get your
great improvements onto the website:

1. **Before doing any work, open a new issue** to discuss your idea.
   This helps ensure that our visions align. We'd hate for you to do
   work that we then couldn't merge!
2. **Fork** the project. [:information_source:][forking]
3. **Create a "topic branch"**, describing your change. eg.
   `my-special-feature`.
4. Make some commits.
5. As early as you'd like, **create a "pull request"** for your branch into
   `master`.
6. When you think your changes are ready, post a pull request comment to
   say so, and **ask for a review**.
7. **We'll review your changes**. Then we'll either:
  1. merge them right away, or
  2. ask you to make some changes.
    - Don't worry! This is totally no big deal! Working together to get
      things just right is a common dynamic in contributing to projects.
      We'll work together on it!
8. After coming to agreement on the best possible contribution, **we'll
   merge your changes** into `master`!
9. Your changes are now live on the website. Yay! Thanks a bunch!
